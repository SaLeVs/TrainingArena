    // We have a way to create a script that automate the process of importing assets on unity
    // its similar to presets, but we can modify more settings and work with code and automaticaly apply the settings
    // For use we have to inherit from AssetPostProcessor class
    // We have voids line OnProcessModel
    // Its more complex but in big projects we use for automate for artists
