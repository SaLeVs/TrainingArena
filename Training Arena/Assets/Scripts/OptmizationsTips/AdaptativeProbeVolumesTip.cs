    // APVs wich provide a sophisticated solution for handling global illumination in Unity, allowing for dynamic and efficient lighting in complex scenes.

    // APVs can optmize both performance and visual quality particularly on mobile and lower end services, while offering advanced capabillities for high end platforms

    // first step, is create a lighting seetings asset, and after change the lighing mode for Baked indirect
    // after that, will create a nwe adaptive probe volume, and set the volume size, and the resolution, and the number of probes
    // make global on light probes
    // After that we just need to bake the probes

    // according with the youtuber, the difference between the light probes and the adaptive probe volumes, is that the adaptive probe volumes are more optimized for mobile devices, and manually configs
