    /*
      Render pipelines

        Built in - Old and have some issues
        Universal render pipeline - adaptable, better performance, intented to be universal, runs on every plataform, maximium compatibility
        high definition render pipeline - maximum fidelity, intender for consoles and high end pcs
      
        URP and HRP have shaders graph and visual effect graph

        have diferrence when you add a object on scene and when you add a object on project
      
        We can change the shaders on graphics on project settings

        but if we do that, we need to chenge the materials on edit/render pipeline/universal render pipeline/upgrade project materials to universalRP Materials
