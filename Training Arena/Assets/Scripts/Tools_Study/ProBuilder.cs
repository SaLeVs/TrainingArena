public class ProBuilder : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Do 3D Modelling directly inside Unity. Extremely useful for quickly whhiteboxing levels
    // we need to add on package manager

    // the most crazy about this powerfull tool is that we can modify 3d models that already have created on other software, just ProBuilderize it  
    // The uv editor tool is also very useful to modify the UVs of the models

    // Destroy and slice objects inside Unity
    // On preferences, we have the probuilder section, toggle the option to enable experimental features

    // We have 3 modes: Intersection, union and subtraction

    // Intersection: we can select 2 objects and make a new object with the intersection of the 2 objects
    // Union: we make a mix of the 2 objects
    // Subtraction: we remove the object 2 from object 1

    // when we make this, we need to set the pivot of the object, because we have some bugs
