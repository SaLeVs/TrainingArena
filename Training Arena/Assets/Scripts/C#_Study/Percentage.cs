using UnityEngine;

public class Percentage : MonoBehaviour
{
    // percentage = (part / total) * 100

    // For example, 20 students in a classroom with 50 students, pass on the exam
    // ( part (20) / total (50) ) * 100 = 40% - 40% of the students passed the exam


    // We can calculate the part based on the percentage and the total

    // for example, if one item represents 30% of the total, and the total is 100
    // part = (30 / 100) * 100 = 30, so 30% of 100 is 30


    // We can calculate the percentual increase or decrease between two values
    // new value = old value * (1 + increase / 100) or (1 - decrease/100);

    // for example, if the old value is 100 and the increase is 10%
    // new value = 100 * (1 + 10 / 100) = 110

    // We can calculate the percentual variation between two values
    // variation = ((final value - inicial value) / inicial value) * 100
