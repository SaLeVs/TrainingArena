public class DesignPatterns : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Multiple pre-made solutions to solve commom problems
    // Comand Pattern: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing requests, and logging requests, and supporting undoable operations.
    // Observer Pattern: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
    // Comand can be good for undo actinos
    // Observer can be good for UI updates, use of events

    // we dont need to know all the patterns, but we need to know when to use them
    // we can use patterns to solve problems in a more organized way
