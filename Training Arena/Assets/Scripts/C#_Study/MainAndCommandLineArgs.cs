    // How to make more complex console apps with arguments

    // all engine have a start and break point, and is simple for unity
    // the start point is the Start() method
    // the break point is when player press the quit button
    // normally people make a console app with a Main() method, because they dont have a UI to see the program running
    // we can use args to pass arguments to the program, like a file path, or a number, or a string, this in unity is not common, but is possible
    // in c#, we can have only one start point, so we can have only one Main() method, but we can acess and set where the start point
